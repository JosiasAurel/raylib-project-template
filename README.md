# RayLib Project Template

A template that to a basic raylib project. This template does not depend on Notepad++ or any other editor.

## Usage

First make sure you have installed the latest version of raylib from [here](https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib/purchase?popup=1)

Start by cloning this repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JosiasAurel/raylib-project-template.git
```

Now set up the raylib in the environment variables.
Use the below command if you are on Windows. On Linux, it should be something similar (haven't tested).

```shell
set RAYLIB_PATH=C:\raylib\raylib
```

Now to test if this example works, run `make` in the project root.
This will execute the makefile and you should see a window appearing

If everything worked fine, then you are good to go build cool stuff.
